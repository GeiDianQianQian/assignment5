1. In my opinion, the fix 2 (the Central Limit Theorem) is the
closed to satisfying the assumptions.

2. Original T-test: assume the distribution is normal, and ask
how unusual it was to get the data we got. According to the
answer to decide if we can assume it is normal distribution
Transformed data T-test: run data through some function that
preserves the stuff. Transforming is generally most useful when
we have a very skewed distribution

3. In my opinion, the fix 1 (transforming data) can get a better
answer. Because for the fix 3, it already has changed the question.
Compared with fix 1, the fix 2 can get closed to the satisfying
assumptions by using different functions.

4. In weekday, there are more Reddit comments posted in Canada.
