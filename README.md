This assignment is for analyzing data statistic by doing T-test. There are two parts: `Summary Statistics, Data Exploration` and Reddit Weekends.

## Summary Statistics and Data Exploration:
  - Main file: summary.ipynb
  - Dataset files are data-*.csv
  - Calculate mean, standard deviation, and range (min and max) for both X and Y ariables.
  - Calculate correlation coefficient `r` between X and Y variables
  - Print data shape by using scatter
  
  

## Reddit Weekends:
  - Main file: reddit_weekends.py
  - Dataset file is reddit-counts.json.gz
  - Transform data by using np.log, np.exp, np.sqrt, counts**2
  - Apply the Central Limit Theorem
  - Perform U-test on data counts
